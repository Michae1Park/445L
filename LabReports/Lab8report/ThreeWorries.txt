	-Might make the screen scroll side ways

	-will use PCB
	-will use Normal 9V Duracel Battery for power source
	-will have a case

2) Discuss the testing features of your design. 

	-We will have testpoints for Speaker pin and the slidepot pin on our PCB board.
	-We have logic anaylzer connected in our PCB
	-Our software debugging features include printf statements here and there.

3) Discuss your top three worries about finishing Lab 11 on time. 

	-Problem with PCB board
	-Unstable ESP Wifi Module
	-change in open API addresses or cessation of their service
