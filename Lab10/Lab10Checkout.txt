cap removes unwanted DC generated from the tachometer.
two diode and resistors (safety feature - preven oscillation caused by back emf)
-upper diode: when middle goes above 3.3v, forward bias and current comes back through resistor brings down the voltage to 3.3v
-lower diode: when middle goes below 0, forward bias, and current comes back through the diode goes down to lower resistor.
basically prevents voltage overflow and underflow

opa2350 is a comparator - if voltage coming in to (-) is bigger than the reference (+) -> high
							else -> low

						:: positive feedback saturates to the extreme


software - input capture, measure pulse width, find period/speed and use them in PI control
